# Israeli New Shekel - Drivers of Its Strength

A relatively strong shekel matters to Israel’s local economy because of the country’s structure as a small, open, and import-dependent economy with a high concentration of high-value exports. Israel imports a large share of what households and businesses consume, including food, energy, vehicles, and raw materials. When the shekel is strong, these imports are cheaper, which directly lowers the cost of living and helps protect household purchasing power. This is especially important in Israel, where price increases are felt quickly and can translate into social and political pressure. By keeping import prices in check, a strong currency plays a central role in containing inflation.

Currency strength also helps anchor inflation expectations. In an economy as open as Israel’s, a weakening currency can quickly feed into prices, wages, and contracts, creating a self-reinforcing inflation cycle. A stable and strong shekel allows the Bank of Israel to manage inflation without resorting to aggressive interest rate hikes, supporting smoother economic growth and reducing financial stress on households and businesses.

Unlike traditional manufacturing economies, Israel’s export base is dominated by technology, software, defense, and intellectual property. These exports are typically high-margin, priced in foreign currency, and relatively insensitive to exchange rate movements. As a result, a weaker shekel does not significantly boost export volumes, while it does raise domestic costs and inflation. For Israel, the benefits of a weak currency are therefore limited, while the costs are immediate and widespread.

A strong shekel also contributes to financial stability. Israeli households carry significant debt, and borrowing costs are sensitive to inflation and interest rates. Currency instability would quickly translate into higher mortgage payments, increased risk premiums, and pressure on pension funds and financial institutions. Stability in the currency reduces volatility across the financial system and keeps long-term borrowing costs more manageable.

Investor confidence is another key factor. Israel depends heavily on foreign investment, venture capital, and access to global bond markets. A strong and stable currency signals institutional credibility, disciplined monetary policy, and economic resilience. This perception lowers financing costs for both the government and the private sector. Persistent currency weakness, even in the presence of strong fundamentals, would raise doubts and increase the cost of capital.

Finally, currency strength supports broader social and political stability. Inflation disproportionately affects lower-income households and those on fixed incomes, widening inequality and fueling unrest. In a country facing ongoing geopolitical pressures, economic stability is itself a strategic asset. While a strong shekel can hurt certain exporters and tourism, policymakers generally accept these trade-offs in exchange for lower inflation, financial stability, and sustained confidence. For Israel, maintaining a strong and stable currency aligns with its economic model and serves as a foundation for long-term resilience.
